Make Sure To Run:
	source RC/bin/activate
Before Testing Any PS4 Python Code
Because it won't register evdev or the controller otherwise

Fri. 10/25/24
	Created doc
	Started an outline in comments since I still didn't know how
to code in Python

Wed. 10/30/24
	Figured out what pins we will use
	Looked up how to output values to RPi in Python. Referencing
an LED light strength code
	Realized that the test code for IDing controller buttons is
also in Python and can be used in motorDrive.py too
	Added in PS4 controller code and if-statements for input
	GPIO might not work on RPi 5 :skull:

	Next Time:
	Might need to switch to using lgpio
	Or link this RPi to GitHub and VSCode
	Or find another way to get around gpio locks

Fri. 11/01/24
	Door locked. No work done

Wed. 11/06/24
	Linked RPi5 to IGVC GitHub
	Downloaded VSCode
	Started documentation documents
	> Not sure what the RC file is in the home directory on the RPi or if it's needed to run the code
	> Will figure that out next time
	> Actually, it's in the top instructions (Make Sure To Run: ...) so it's probably necessary
	Moved RC into PS Controller Code folder

	Next Time:
	Might need to switch to using lgpio
	Or find another way to get around gpio locks on RPi5
